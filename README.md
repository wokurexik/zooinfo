# Zoo Info (This project is no longer active. Maybe I will finish it one day :))

Zoo info is a website, where are all the information about Zoos, Minizoos, Zooparks, and more.

This project is very not done :D, there is a lot of bugs and weird things happening, but we will get there eventually.

For those, who don't want to install it to see, how it looks. Here are some screenshots:
